# Building Monitoring and Automation System
Welcome to my Building Management System repository! This project showcases a small-scale implementation of a building monitoring system using Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and an LCD text display. The system is designed to monitor temperature, door/window status, and detect motion to automate lighting control within a building environment. Feel free to watch my demonstration below!

## üè¢ Project Overview
The Building Monitoring and Automation System is a demonstration of how modern technologies can be utilized to create an intelligent monitoring and automation solution for buildings. The system leverages Raspberry Pi's capabilities and integrates multiple sensors to gather real-time data and provide automated responses based on environmental changes.

## üåü Key Features
- **Temperature Monitoring**: The system uses temperature sensors to track and display indoor temperature in real-time.

- **Door/Window Status A/C Controller**: Buttons are employed to simulate the status of doors and windows, indicating whether they are open or closed and turns on or off the AC based on its status.

- **Automated Lighting Control**: PIR motion sensors enable the system to automatically control lighting based on detected motion, providing enhanced energy efficiency.

- **LCD Text Display**: The system uses an LCD text display to present essential information, including temperature readings, door/window status, and motion detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi: The heart of the system, running the code and orchestrating sensor interactions.

- Temperature Sensor: To measure and monitor the indoor temperature.

- Buttons: For simulating the open/close status of doors and windows and changing the desired temperature. 

- PIR Motion Sensors: To detect motion and trigger automated lighting.

- LCD Text Display: Providing real-time information to building occupants.

- Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the system's logic.
